## matrices for describing the multi-camera layout

# fps is the frame rate of each camera

# offsets denote the time difference between cameras, if these values are
# added to them respectively, they become synchronized

# The (i,j)-th element of the compatibility matrix shows whether a track from
# the j-th camera can be appended to one in the i-th camera.

# The (i,j)-th element of dtmin and dtmax denotes the timeframe for matching.
# If the track left camera i at t, it has to appear on j 
# in the interval [t - dtmin, t + dtmax]
# infinity is denoted by -inf or inf.
