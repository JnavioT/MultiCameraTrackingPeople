## matrices for describing the multi-camera layout

# fps is the frame rate of each camera

# scales and offsets help synchronize the cameras
# scales help to adjust multiplicative difference:
# e.g the same events take t1 time on camera1, and t2 on camera2, then the scales can be: 1.0, t2/t1
# meaning that what takes 1.0 time on camera1 it takes t2/t1 time on camera2

# offsets denote the additive difference between cameras:
# if camera2 starts 10 seconds after camera1, offsets can be: 0.0, 10.0

# The (i,j)-th element of the compatibility matrix shows whether a track from
# the j-th camera can be appended to one in the i-th camera.

# The (i,j)-th element of dtmin and dtmax denotes the timeframe for matching.
# If the track left camera i at t, it has to appear on j 
# in the interval [t + dtmin, t + dtmax]
# infinity is denoted by -inf or inf.
